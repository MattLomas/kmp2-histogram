# kmp2-histogram
KMP-2 histogram exercise solution.
---
Simple exercise solution example in pyhton.<br />
It seemed a good opportunity to progress my python learning journey.

Additionall, I managed a partial exercise solution using BASH scripting
on a MacOS device.

Note that the python she-bang (line one) was never required given my invokation as follows:

$> python3 /path/to/scipt/0.pyhton.histogram.script.py
